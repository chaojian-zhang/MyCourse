Basic Functionality Specification:
1. Provides information on all available courses, categorized
2. Provides facilities to add and modify existing course informations
3. Provides profile management and CERA checking much like magellan
4. Provides real-time preview of changes and existing problems in portfolio
5. Provides ultimate easy-to-use time table visualization

Usage Convention:
1. Course Code is just a string and supports spaces, but for our provided library we will use only ECE221H1 without 'F' or 'H' because it's already available in time slots; No just do it because that's how our university do it; Thus ECE221H1F and ECE221H1W are two courses if we do it this way
